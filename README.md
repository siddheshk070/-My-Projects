# My-Projects
Data Science Portfolio Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

It includes projects and work I have completed using real-world data sets. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience in this field. I aim to work as a data scientist by mid-2023.
