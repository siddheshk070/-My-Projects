## US Crime Data Exploration and Analysis (EXCEL)

DESCRIPTION

*Problem Scenario*: An organized quantitative and qualitative investigation is done to find trends in crime and disorder. Information on these patterns helps law enforcement agencies deploy resources more effectively. Crime analysis plays an important role in devising solutions to crime problems and formulating crime prevention strategies. 

## About
The dataset is  available on my Github, 
Crime analysis provides a process, which incorporates crime into site analysis.1 The analysis is sometimes called a safety audit or risk assessment. This process has been developed based on a variety of neighborhoods and sites and in particular areas ranging from neighborhood developments, transit stations, mega-block developments, park designs, public realm plazas, and corporate/business operations. An outline of the analysis process includes:

1. Demographic analysis,

2. Crime analysis,

3. Site analysis,

4. Use analysis,

5. Neighborhood/user consultation, and

6. Pathway analysis.

Situational crime prevention incorporates other crime prevention and law enforcement strategies in an effort to focus on place-specific crime problems.</p>

## Task
The goal of this analysis to understand crime rate in US. What kind of crimes are most prevalent in US? Are there certain times when crime is more likely to occur? If so, when? Find if there is any major difference in the regions of US in crime rate.
