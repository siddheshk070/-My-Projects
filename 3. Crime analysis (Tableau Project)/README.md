# **Crime Analysis Dashboard**-(Tableau Project)

DESCRIPTION

*Problem Scenario*: Crime analysis is important for law-and-order maintenance at any place. It helps the police department and law enforcement agencies to identify patterns of crime, which is crucial for the effective planning of a crime prevention program. The purpose of crime data analysis is to support the operations of the police department, like a criminal investigation, apprehension, prosecution, and development of crime prevention and reduction strategies.

## About
The dataset is  available on my Github, 
Crime analysis provides a process, which incorporates crime into site analysis.1 The analysis is sometimes called a safety audit or risk assessment. This process has been developed based on a variety of neighborhoods and sites and in particular areas ranging from neighborhood developments, transit stations, mega-block developments, park designs, public realm plazas, and corporate/business operations. An outline of the analysis process includes:

1. Demographic analysis,

2. Crime analysis,

3. Site analysis,

4. Use analysis,

5. Neighborhood/user consultation, and

6. Pathway analysis.

Situational crime prevention incorporates other crime prevention and law enforcement strategies in an effort to focus on place-specific crime problems.</p>

## Task
As a data scientist, you should prepare a dashboard to keep the police department and the city updated on the statistics of crime events. You are required to create a dashboard/story using tableau for the communication website. Pay attention to data storytelling
